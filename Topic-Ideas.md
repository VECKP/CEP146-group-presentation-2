## Main Topic
The World’s First Major Law Regulating Artificial Intelligence

This presentation focuses on why the European Union created the EU AI Act, what problems it is meant to solve, and how it affects the future of artificial intelligence and software development.

## Why the EU AI Act Was Created
### 1. Unregulated Commercial Surveillance & Spyware
Before this law, many AI-powered tracking systems and data collection tools operated without strong oversight. These systems could be used for:
- Predatory advertising
- Constant user tracking
- Exploiting personal data without consent

The EU AI Act was created to limit how companies can collect and use sensitive user data.

### 2. Deepfakes & Social Manipulation
AI can now create:
- Fake videos
- Fake voices
- Fake images of real people  

These deepfakes can be used for:
- Political misinformation
- Online fraud & scams
- Hate speech & propaganda

The EU AI Act requires transparency and labeling for certain AI-generated content to reduce manipulation.

### 3. Facial Recognition & Mass Surveillance
Facial recognition AI can:
- Identify people in public spaces
- Track movement without permission
- Be used by governments or companies without consent

The EU AI Act restricts real-time facial recognition in public spaces except in very limited law enforcement situations.

## Connection to Software Development
This law directly affects:
- AI developers
- Software engineers
- Tech startups
- Large AI companies

Developers must now follow legal rules when building and releasing AI systems in the European Union.

## Why This Topic Matters
The EU AI Act is important because:
- It is the first major AI law in the world
- Other countries may copy it
- It changes how AI software is built forever
