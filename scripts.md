## Ashley – Introduction (EU AI Act)

Today, we’re talking about the EU AI Act, which is the world’s first major law created to regulate artificial intelligence. As AI continues to grow rapidly and become part of everyday technology, governments around the world have started paying closer attention to how it is developed and used. The European Union was the first to introduce a full legal framework specifically for artificial intelligence, setting a global standard for how AI systems should be controlled and governed.


## david – impact

The EU AI Act has a major impact on how AI is developed and used. On the positive side, it increases safety by limiting the use of harmful AI systems, reducing deepfake risks, and requiring greater transparency from companies. This helps build trust and protects people from misuse.

However, the act also creates challenges. The strict rules can slow down innovation, especially for smaller companies that may struggle with compliance costs. Some businesses warn that these regulations could push AI development and investment away from Europe. Overall, the act improves safety but also creates new challenges for growth and competition.
