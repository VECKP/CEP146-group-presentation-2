## Ashley – Introduction (EU AI Act)

Today, we’re talking about the EU AI Act, which is the world’s first major law created to regulate artificial intelligence. As AI started becoming more powerful, governments became worried about how it was being used. Things like constant online surveillance, deepfakes, and facial recognition technology raised serious concerns about privacy, safety, and misuse. Because of these growing risks, the European Union decided that AI could no longer remain completely unregulated. That decision led to the creation of the EU AI Act.
